                    <p><span class="first-letter">H</span>arrison Marshall, a 28-year-old architect, moved into an 8-square-metre skip house in Bermondsey, South East London, at the end of last year as part of a public art project to “highlight the housing crisis being faced by the community.”</p>
                    <p>It all started when he moved back to London in 2022 after spending a few years living abroad and needed to find a place to live, but prices were “through the roof.”</p>
                    <p>The skip house is located on an empty plot of land in Bermondsey, which is owned by Antepavilion, an arts and architecture charity. Inside the house, there is a small living space and a mezzanine shelf for his bed. Below the bed, there’s a small kitchen comprised of just a sink and space for a cooktop, but there’s no bathroom. Instead, there is a portable toilet outside, and Marshall showers at his work or the gym.</p>
                    <p>“I wanted to hammer home the realities of the rental situation in London by creating something that could be considered better than many of the rooms on offer around London, even though it was in a dumpster”, Marshall says.</p>
                    <p>Marshall is one of many young people who can’t afford to rent a place to live in London, let alone buy a house. Owning a home is the biggest investment most people will make in their lives and will usually be one of the largest assets an individual owns. Most Britons aspire to owning their own home, as revealed in a <a href="https://www.santander.co.uk/assets/s3fs-public/documents/santander-first-time-buyer-study.pdf">study</a> by Santander in 2019, with nine out of ten young Britons, aged 18 to 34, stating that they aspire to own a home, with half of them putting it as their biggest goal.</p>

        <p>However, for many young people in London the prospect of one day owning their own home has become a very distant dream, with house prices having risen faster than wages in recent decades. In the 1980s and 1990s, the average full-time worker could expect to pay about three times their annual earnings to buy a home in England. By 2022, this increased to more than eight times their annual wages. In London, the situation is even worse, with a normal worker now needing to save thirteen times their annual income in order to purchase a house.</p>

                <p>She further explains that younger people are experiencing rising interest rates at the moment, which could make their mortgages more expensive and, potentially, unaffordable. Meanwhile, the money working-age people take home after tax is being squeezed by high inflation.</p>

            <p>The Bank of England raised interest rates for the 13th consecutive time last month to 5 percent, the highest level since 2008, in response to the high inflation. As a consequence, more than 1.4 million households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20 percent of their disposable income, as highlighted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in their latest <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/interest-rate-hikes-could-see-14-million-people-lose-20-their-disposable-income">report</a>.</p>
        </div>       
    </div>

    <div class="uk-container uk-margin-bottom">
        <p>The IFS also warns that the heaviest blow would be reserved for those under the age of 40 with larger mortgages, with the biggest financial hit for households in London and the South East of England.</p>
        <p>With mortgage costs at a record high and the soaring cost of living crisis, being able to save up enough to buy a house for young people seems unrealistic; but it hasn’t always been this way. What, specifically, has gone wrong in the housing sector that has made it get worse in England, particularly in London, over the last few decades?</p>

Further Acts during the 20s and 30s extended the duty of local councils to make housing available as a social service. As a consequence, local councils built a total of 1.1 million homes.</p>

It allowed council house tenants to buy the homes they lived in and forced local authorities to sell their properties on request at a discount. Nationally, 1 million houses were sold within 10 years.</p>

                The excessive demand for housing as a financial asset, rather than as a place to live, has been the main challenge facing the UK housing market since the 1990s.</p>

              <p class="timeline__content-desc">Over the next two decades falling interest rates and rising house prices persuaded more and more people that the property market was a good place to invest. In the 2000s, an average of 200,000 buy-to-let mortgages were approved per year. Not only did this expand the rental market but it was another element driving house prices up.</p>

              <p class="timeline__content-desc">The global financial crisis led to a severe tightening of credit conditions. Banks stopped lending as freely, and people found it harder to get mortgages. This, in turn, led to a sharp decline in property prices, as buyers dried up and sellers struggled to offload their properties. From 2008 to 2009, property prices fell by 15 percent in England and 20 percent in London.</p>

              <p class="timeline__content-desc">The housing market struggled after the 2008 crisis; then the government made a dramatic intervention to get the housing market moving with the launch of Help to buy scheme that enabled first-time buyers to purchase a property with a 5 percent deposit and access an equity loan from the government worth up to 40 percent of the property, paid back interest-free for five years. But Office for Budget Responsibility members said mortgage subsidies would push up prices and have little impact on demand.</p>

The UK government introduced the stamp duty holiday in July 2020 to boost the property market during the pandemic. Despite the disruption in most areas of the economy, house prices in England climbed by 8.5 percent during 2020, according to the ONS. The price rise was partly fuelled by a rush to buy during the stamp duty holiday.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the average age of first-time buyers has increased over the years across the country, from 31 in 2003/04 to 33 in 2021/22. In London, the average age of first-time buyers was higher than the rest of the country during the timeline, increasing from 32 in 2003 to 37 in 2019. It did drop, however, to 34 in 2022 after the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests that young people in London have to save for a house deposit for a longer period now than in the past, and also for longer time than their peers in the rest of the country.</p>

            <p>Young people are disproportionately affected by the housing crisis in London. As house prices rise faster than wages and the social housing stock remains in short supply, growing numbers of young people are being pushed into the private rental sector in London. In this economy, it is even harder for them to save money for a house deposit.</p>
            <p>In 2021, young adults between 25 and 34 years old account for the highest proportion in the private rental sector in comparison with any other age group within London. Not surprisingly, outright owners were concentrated among the older age bands, 50 and over, while mortgagors were typically in the middle age bands, 35-to-49-year-olds.</p>

            <p>Some people believe that cutting out Netflix subscriptions, Starbucks, and take-away food will help young people save for a house deposit. However, to accumulate enough savings for a mortgage, one would need to abstain from Netflix subscriptions for over 200 years or stop drinking Starbucks every day for the next 100 years, in order to save for an average £100,000 deposit for a house in London.</p>
            <p>According to the ONS, the average house price is 58 times higher than it was in the 1970s, yet the price of other products has only increased by five to ten times.</p>

                    <p>Nishan Hussain, a coordinator of the rough sleeping support programme at Brent London Borough Council, and housing consultant at Hertfordshire County Council, says the main reason behind the housing crisis that the young are now facing is that salaries are not going up in line with house prices.</p>
                    <p>"The cost of living and inflation are sky-high; interest rates and mortgage repayments are extremely unaffordable in those circumstances. How do you expect a young person to get on the property ladder?", she questions.</p>
                    <p>Another problem is the affordability test for mortgages, according to Hussain. With the high cost of living, there are very few chances for many young people to pass that test in order to borrow from the bank.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, Nick Gallent, professor of housing and planning at University College London (UCL), explains that housing has become an investment vehicle in London, with its position as a global city, which has driven the demand side beyond the supply, pushing house prices out of reach for many young people.</p>  
                    <p>He further adds that London’s housing problems are also rooted in unequal distribution and inequality in access to the housing resource, which is concentrated in the hands of investors and older generations.</p>
                    <p>“London is getting to a point where there are plenty of expensive flats for investors and really nothing that people on ordinary incomes can afford”, states Gallent.</p>

                <p>He also highlights that for the younger generations, who are at an earlier stage of career development in a rising market where wages are stagnating and asset prices are growing, the younger they are, the more disadvantaged they will be.</p>
                <p>The UCL professor warns that some of the current programmes to assist young people in obtaining housing, such as the deposit-free or help to buy, don't actually help to address the enduring issues in the housing system because "they're not concerned with the fundamental question of the relationship between earnings and house prices."</p>
                <p>He explains that those programmes will encourage more cash flow into the housing market, which could potentially push prices up.</p>
                <p>"We're at a point of a difficult dynamic at the moment because everything is sort of locked; the whole system is locked. House prices are teetering, but they're not dropping substantially. Rents are increasing as landlords try to recover the costs as a result of rising interest rates and falling tax relief. Meanwhile, homeowners are struggling with higher mortgage costs. In the end, nobody's happy", he says.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Centrepoint, the youth homelessness charity, started the <a href="https://centrepoint.org.uk/what-we-do/independent-living-programme/">Independent Living Programme</a> in 2017 to deliver affordable accommodation to young people, with rent below one-third of their monthly income.</p>
        <p>The 21-square-metre flats provided by Centrepoint have a kitchen, dining area, bathroom, bed and a space to relax in. The purpose-built modular homes are the first affordable dwellings to be specifically built to help people at risk of homelessness, as schemes like this usually use refurbished housing, according to Centrepoint.</p>

        <p>Even though these programmes have helped thousands of young Londoners survive the cost-of-living crisis, there is still an urgent need to fix the broken housing market that has left a large number of young people in the capital city that live in poor housing conditions and are unable to buy their own home.</p>
        <p>Professor Gallent says: "Housing unaffordability is a massive barrier to labour mobility and labour supply, and it's going to adversely affect the foundational economy of big cities, like London, where they need more than their in-situ population to drive their economy."</p>
        <p>Building more affordable houses is one way to solve the problem, as suggested by many experts and researchers, but another solution, in Gallent’s opinion, is the introduction of land value or property tax, as well as capital gains tax (on the value-uplift of a property from point of purchase to point of sale), which are not charged on a principal home.</p>
        <p>"The government perhaps should bring the taxation of housing into line with other assets, discouraging over-investment in the housing market in London", he further adds.</p>
        <p>At a local level, Hussain suggests that the UK government should give more funding to local authorities for affordable housing and develop policies to encourage housing associations, as well as focus on investing in the community rather than the private sector.</p>
        <p>"The government should invest in and prioritise the community’s living conditions, health, and wellbeing because people are suffering massively as a result of it", she says.</p>

        <p>Marshall, the owner of the skip house, describes what it's like to live in a dumpster, saying that the Old Kent Road traffic wakes him up every day and that he doesn't have running water; instead, he gets it from his neighbours, filling up a bucket every day to cook and wash his plates.</p>
        <p>"It seems crazy that people work in the city and can’t afford to live here, or people who have lived here their whole lives can’t afford to stay here, so they’re having to move out", he says, further adding: “No one should have to live in a skip.”</p>
        <p>As his story has gone viral on social media and appeared in various newspapers, Marshall is hoping to ignite a conversation around housing and how wasteland is used. "There’s got to be more creative solutions to the housing crisis," he states. </p>
        <p>London needs to deliver more affordable homes for young people, who contribute to their city in so many ways, if it is to remain the vibrant, cosmopolitan, and creative centre we know it to be.</p>
